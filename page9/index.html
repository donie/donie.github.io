<div class="entry-content"><p>After the using rb file to import the posts from Textpattern, which I find a little bit tricky is that all posts&#8217; detailed post time kinda lost, like original post time is &#8220;Mar 15th, 2011 21:59:00&#8221;, only the date were available exists, but the detail hour/minute got lost, kinda pity.</p>
<p>And for Jekyll part, I personally cloned this <a href="http://mojombo.github.com">repository</a> , it definitely meet regular requirement for blogging. But if the pagination is a demand, add this line in _config.yml</p>
<p></notextile></p>
<p>3 is the number of posts for each page. More information could be grab from <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Pagination">here</a> . <em>See? It is in the wiki! But you can&#8217;t find it on the wiki&#8217;s home page.</em></p>
<p>On jekyll&#8217;s page structure, basically, it start from the index.html in the root container, and uses the file _layout folder. Extremely like what I have in Textpattern :)</p>
<p>And for code highlighting, pygments is great, and also which is part of github&#8217;s default setting(github uses jekyll  --pygments --safe), you may need put pygments: true in _config.xml. <em>Pygments does a bit slow</em></p>

<p>Well, I always said to myself, leave it tomorrow, you&#8217;ll have time to do it. In my face: I already forget details that have been done in this setup&#8230;</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>As may noticed, this blog was moved to full static pages, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> , the fantastic page generator.</p>
<p>As well, this procedure also evolves ruby stuffs, which cost about half and day for a newbie like me to sort all these things out. Trying to list all the problems I met below, 所谓以儆效尤啊, lol:</p>
<p>rvm things, so following the topic in last article, version thing does cost a lot of time to deal with. At first, I would like to think that put</p>
</notextile>

p. should list all ruby versions in the system, also include the version that come that from the system. But actually it's NOT. so use this:

<notextile><p>Voila.</p>
<p>For import textpattern blog posts to Jekyll, this part is pretty funny though. First, you&#8217;ll need to copy the import utility(textpattern.rb) to local disk, and use the ruby file to import all you posts. Grab the open_gem to meet the prerequisite:</p>
</notextile>

p. than

<notextile><p>On my laptop, this will let vim to open the package structure, open that file and save it into wherever you want. then import data from txp database</p>
</notextile>

p. This file's operation could be tricky, it's database name was hard coded as "textpattern", in my previous environment, the database name is txp_textpattern, so be aware of that. And also you may need add a new line

<notextile><p>in the rb file, cause I met this problem.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>So, start learning ruby, maybe more proper to use RoR(definitely sure that, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson">Hansson</a> or someone else get the abbreviation inspiration from lol, or maybe not).<br />
First day, meet something frustrating, following logs when trying to access the welcome aboard page:</p>
<pre>Please install the sqlite3 adapter: `gem install activerecord-sqlite3-adapter` (can't activate sqlite3 (~&gt; 1.3.4), already activated sqlite3-1.3.3. Make sure all dependencies are added to Gemfile.)
/Users/[user]/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@rails3/gems/activerecord-3.1.0/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_specification.rb:71:in `rescue in establish_connection'</pre>
<p>Googled this message around (also on stackoverflow, lol), no findings. At last, changing the sqlite3 gem version to 1.3.4 actually did the trick, which original content generated by rails 3.1.0 is:</p>
<pre>gem 'sqlite3', '1.3.3', :group =&gt; :development</pre>
<p>After playing with this for some time, off the top of my head: <span class="caps">WTF</span>, don&#8217;t they guys  find that the whole version things does messed people around? Hope will learn the story behind this in the future.</p></div>
